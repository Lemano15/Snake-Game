            <p>The player controls a square on a bordered plane and as it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind. There are
                'apples' randomly spread around the plane, and the goal is to use the keypad to move the snake towards those apples.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, the snake continually gets longer as it collects more apples. The goal of the game is to make the snake as long
                as possible without running into itself or the borders.
